This project is a Flight Booking Application. In this application, users can search for flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings. All user data is stored in a central database. Logged-in users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their bookings. Additionally, users can update their profiles and change their passwords if they forget them. The application also includes pagination for easy navigation through flight listings.
